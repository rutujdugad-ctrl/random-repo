- The reformulation is often chosen for numerical convenience, not because it simplifies the order of the equations.
- The complexity in terms of differential order remains equivalent to the original Navier-Stokes equations.
---
- When dye is injected at a point in a flow, it traces the locations of all fluid particles that have passed through that point over time—this is called the streak line. At any later moment, the ends of these dye traces match the endpoints of the particles’ path lines through the injection point.

## Stream Function and Velocity Components

For two-dimensional incompressible flow, the velocity components \(u\) and \(v\) can be expressed using the stream function \(\psi(x,y)\) as:

$$
u = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}
$$

$$
v = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}
$$

- Here, \(u\) is the velocity component in the \(x\)-direction.
- \(v\) is the velocity component in the \(y\)-direction.
- The stream function \(\psi\) is a scalar function, constant along streamlines.
- This formulation automatically satisfies the continuity equation for incompressible flow.
---
- Eulerian approach: Observes and describes fluid properties at fixed points in space as time changes.
- Lagrangian approach: Follows and describes the motion of individual fluid particles as they move through space and time.

## General Form of 2nd order PDE
$$
A \phi_{xx} + B \phi_{xy} + C \phi_{yy} + D \phi_x + E \phi_y + F \phi + G = 0
$$

### Classification Criterion

$$
\Delta = B^2 - 4AC
$$
- If $\Delta < 0$: Elliptic PDE  
- If $\Delta = 0$: Parabolic PDE  
- If $\Delta > 0$: Hyperbolic PDE  

### PDE Types and Examples

| Type      | Properties                                | Examples                              |

## Laplacian Operator
- Mathematical form: $\nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}$
- Explanation: Measures how a quantity diffuses or spreads out from a point in space.

## Conservation of Momentum Equation (General form)
$$
\rho \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t} = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} + \rho \mathbf{a}
$$
- $\rho$: fluid density  
- $\frac{D}{D t}$: material derivative (rate of change following a fluid particle)  
- $\mathbf{u}$: velocity vector  
- $p$: pressure  
- $\boldsymbol{\tau}$: deviatoric (viscous) stress tensor  
- $\mathbf{a}$: body acceleration (e.g., gravity)

## Navier-Stokes Equation

### For Incompressible Newtonian Fluid
$$
\rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} \right) = - \nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \rho \mathbf{a}
$$
- $\mu$: dynamic viscosity  
- Left side: fluid inertia (acceleration)  
- Right side: pressure force, viscous force, and external body forces

### For Compressible Newtonian Fluid
$$
\rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}\right) = - \nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \left(\mu + \lambda \right) \nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}) + \rho \mathbf{a}
$$
- $\lambda$: second coefficient of viscosity (bulk viscosity)  
- Additional term $\left(\mu + \lambda \right) \nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u})$ accounts for compressibility effects.

## Continuity Equation

### Incompressible Flow
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$
- Constant density, no volume change in fluid particles.

### Compressible Flow
$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$
- Allows density to change with time and space.

## Types of Grids

### Structured Grids
- Regular arrangement of grid points in a curvilinear coordinate system.
- Grid points and cells have a structured, ordered indexing (i, j, k).
- Advantages: Efficient storage, simple neighbor relationships, easier numerical methods.
- Disadvantages: Difficult to fit complex geometries.

### Unstructured Grids
- Irregular arrangement of points and cells, no fixed connectivity pattern.
- Requires explicit connectivity data to define neighbors.
- Can use various cell shapes (triangles, tetrahedrons).
- Advantages: Easily adapts to complex geometries and local refinements.
- Disadvantages: More complex data structure and higher computational cost.

### O-C Type Grids
- Combination of O-type and C-type grid topologies.
- O-type: Grid lines form closed loops around objects (good for around bodies).
- C-type: Grid lines wrap around the body and extend downstream (better wake resolution).
- O-C hybrid combines strengths for complex shapes and flow features.

### Body-Fitted Grids
- Grids that conform closely to the geometry of the physical body.
- Created by mapping flow domain to a computational domain that matches shape.
- Facilitates accurate boundary condition application on complex shapes.
- Can be structured or block-structured with orthogonal or non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinates.
- Common in simulations requiring precise geometric fidelity.

## Forward Difference Second Derivative Scheme

**Scheme:**  
$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{f_{i+2} - 2f_{i+1} + f_i}{\Delta x^2}
$$

- This uses points $i, i+1, i+2$, making it a forward difference.
- Taylor expansion shows the local truncation error is $O(\Delta x)$.
- Thus, **order of accuracy is 1 (first-order accurate)**.
---
## Central Difference Second Derivative Steps

Compute $\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$ for $f(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{4}\right)$ at $x = 1.5$
Step size: $h = 0.01$

### Steps

1. Find $f(x+h)$, $f(x)$, and $f(x-h)$:
   - $f(1.51) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi \times 1.51}{4}\right)$
   - $f(1.5) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi \times 1.5}{4}\right)$
   - $f(1.49) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi \times 1.49}{4}\right)$

1. Apply central difference formula:
$$
\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \approx \frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2}
$$

2. Substitute values and calculate:
   - Plug computed $f$ values and $h = 0.01$ into the formula.

1. The answer is $-0.56$

## Taylor Series Expansion

### Expansion at $f(x)$
$$
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!} (x - a)^k
$$

### Expansion at $f(x + n \Delta x)$
$$
f(x + n \Delta x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!} (n \Delta x)^k
$$

Where:  
- $f^{(k)}(x)$ is the $k$-th derivative of $f$ at $x$.
- $n$ is an integer multiple of the step size $\Delta x$.
- $a$ is the point about which the function $f$ is expanded.

# CFD Numerical Methods MCQ Tips & Tricks for week 3 assignment

## 1. Stability Analysis Tips

### How to Identify Stability Types
**Conditionally Stable:**
- Requires CFL condition: $\Delta t < \text{some limit}$
- Examples: FTCS (Forward Time Central Space), explicit schemes
- **Trick:** Explicit schemes are usually conditionally stable

**Unconditionally Stable:**
- No restrictions on time step $\Delta t$ or CFL number
- Examples: Implicit schemes (Backward Euler), DuFort-Frankel
- **Trick:** Look for "implicit" or "backward" in scheme names

### implicit and explicit scheme

| Feature            | Explicit Scheme                                        | Implicit Scheme                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition         | Computes future values using known past/current values | Involves solving equations with unknown future values |
| Stability          | Conditionally stable, limited by CFL condition         | Usually unconditionally stable                        |
| Computational Cost | Lower, direct update                                   | Higher due to solving systems                         |
| Example            | Forward Euler, FTCS, Explicit RK                       | Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolson, DuFort-Frankel        |

## 2. Order of Accuracy Tips

### How to Determine Order
**From Taylor Series Expansion:**
1. Expand all terms using Taylor series about base point
2. Substitute into finite difference formula
3. **Leading error term** determines order
   - If error $\propto (\Delta x)^n$, then scheme is $n$-th order accurate

**Quick Recognition:**
- **Central differences:** Usually 2nd order
- **Forward/Backward differences:** Usually 1st order
- **Higher-order schemes:** Use more grid points

### Example Pattern Recognition
- $\frac{f_{i+1} - f_{i-1}}{2\Delta x}$ → 2nd order (central)
- $\frac{f_{i+1} - f_i}{\Delta x}$ → 1st order (forward)
- $\frac{f_{i+2} - 2f_{i+1} + f_i}{(\Delta x)^2}$ → Usually 1st or 2nd order

## 3. Taylor Series Term Identification

### Key Formula for MCQs
For $f(x + s)$ where $s = n\Delta x$:
$$f(x + n\Delta x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!} (n\Delta x)^k$$

**Trick:** The "$k$-th derivative term" has coefficient $\frac{f^{(k)}(x)}{k!}$

## 4. Error Type Recognition

### Dissipative vs Dispersive Errors
**Dissipative Error:**
- Caused by **even-order** truncation terms
- Effect: Smooths solutions (numerical diffusion)
- Look for: $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, $\frac{\partial^4}{\partial x^4}$ terms

**Dispersive Error:**
- Caused by **odd-order** truncation terms  
- Effect: Creates oscillations/wiggles
- Look for: $\frac{\partial^3}{\partial x^3}$, $\frac{\partial^5}{\partial x^5}$ terms

## 5. Scheme Recognition Shortcuts

### Common Scheme Properties
**FTCS (Forward Time, Central Space):**
- Time: Forward difference → 1st order in time
- Space: Central difference → 2nd order in space
- Stability: Conditionally stable

**DuFort-Frankel:**
- 2nd order accurate in both time and space
- Unconditionally stable
- **Trick:** If you see "DuFort-Frankel," mark stable + 2nd order

**ADI (Alternating Direction Implicit):**
- For 2D: 2 fractional steps per time step
- For 3D: 3 fractional steps per time step
- Generally more stable than explicit

## 6. Mesh and Discretization Tips

### Finite Volume Method Recognition
- **Cell-centered:** Solutions defined at cell centers
- **Node-based:** Solutions defined at vertices
- **Conservative:** Fluxes balanced across faces

### Influence Patterns
- **Upstream/Downstream influence:** Equally weighted in central schemes
- **Stencil size:** More points → potentially higher order

## 7. Quick MCQ Strategy

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Identify scheme type** (explicit/implicit, forward/central/backward)
2. **Check stability** (look for conditions on $\Delta t$)
3. **Determine accuracy** (count derivatives, check Taylor expansion)
4. **Recognize error types** (even terms = dissipative, odd = dispersive)

### Common MCQ Patterns
- "Which is unconditionally stable?" → Look for implicit schemes
- "Order of accuracy?" → Do Taylor expansion or recognize pattern
- "Third term in series?" → Count carefully from constant term
- "Conservative scheme?" → Finite volume with flux balance

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Don't confuse "third derivative term" with "third term"
- Explicit schemes are rarely unconditionally stable
- Higher order doesn't always mean more stable
- CFL conditions are necessary for stability, not sufficient

## 8. Memory Aids

**STABLE acronym:**
- **S**cheme type (explicit/implicit)
- **T**aylor expansion for accuracy
- **A**mplification factor check
- **B**oundary conditions matter
- **L**eading error term
- **E**ven/odd terms for error type

# CFD Exam Last-Minute Tips & Tricks

### Trick #1: The Peclet Number (Pe) Decider

If a question gives you density, velocity, etc., and asks you to choose a **scheme**, it's a Peclet number question. You don't always have to calculate it perfectly.

1.  **The Magic Number is 2.** Your goal is to figure out if Pe is greater or less than 2.
    * **Formula:** $$Pe = \frac{\rho u L}{\Gamma}$$
    * **Watch out for units!** They will try to trick you. In your assignment (Q1), velocity was in `m/min`. You MUST convert it to `m/s` (divide by 60).
    * `L` is usually the grid size ($\Delta x$). If a 1m pipe has 10 cells, then $L = 1/10 = 0.1$ m.

2.  **The Choice:**
    * If **Pe > 2** (Convection is strong, like a powerful wind): The flow is one-directional.
        * **ANSWER -> First-Order UPWIND**.
    * If **Pe ≤ 2** (Diffusion is strong, like smoke spreading out): The flow is balanced.
        * **ANSWER -> Second-Order CENTRAL DIFFERENCING**.

**MCQ Pro Tip:** If you see a high velocity and low diffusion, it's probably Upwind. If the velocity is low, it's probably Central Differencing.

### Trick #2: 1D Heat Conduction Shortcuts

These are common sense questions disguised in complex formulas.

* **"What is zero at the boundary?" (Like Q8):**
    * For the **first node** on the very left (the "West" boundary), the coefficient connecting it to a neighbor further left ($a_W$) is **ALWAYS 0**. There is no node there!
    * Similarly, for the last node on the right, $a_E$ would be 0.
    * This is often a free point on an exam.

* **"Find the temperature at the center." (Like Q2):**
    * Look for the term "heat generation" ($q$).
    * If there is **NO heat generation** ($q=0$), the temperature in the middle is just the simple average of the ends. Ex: ends are 100°C and 50°C -> middle is 75°C.
    * If there **IS heat generation**, the middle temperature will be **higher** than the simple average. The heat source adds extra heat!

### Trick #3: Keyword Matching for Schemes (For "Match the Following")

This was Q5 in your assignment. Don't memorize formulas, match keywords.

* **First-Order Upwind Scheme:**
    * **Keywords:** "Upstream", "one-sided".
    * **How it works:** It's simple and dumb. It only looks at the node the flow is **coming from**.
    * **Nodes Used:** Just one, the upstream one ($\phi_W$).

* **Central Differencing Scheme:**
    * **Keywords:** "Average", "linear interpolation", "centered".
    * **How it works:** Takes the average of the two nodes on either side.
    * **Nodes Used:** The two closest neighbors ($\phi_W, \phi_P$).

* **QUICK Scheme:**
    * **Keywords:** "Quadratic", "three-point", "higher-order", "expensive".
    * **How it works:** It's the most complicated. It uses a curve (a quadratic) to interpolate.
    * **Nodes Used:** Three nodes are involved ($\phi_{WW}, \phi_W, \phi_P$).
    * **MCQ Pro Tip:** If a question asks which scheme is the most **"computationally expensive"**, the answer is almost always **QUICK**.

### Trick #4: Decoding the Wave Equation

This looks scary but it's just a "plug-and-play" problem.

* **The Equation:** $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$$
* **The Task:** They will tell you how to replace the $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ parts.
    * "Forward Euler" for time ($\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$) means: $$\frac{u_i^{t+\Delta t} - u_i^t}{\Delta t}$$
    * "Central Differencing" for space ($\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$) means: $$\frac{u_{i+1}^t - u_{i-1}^t}{2\Delta x}$$
* **How to Solve:**
    1.  Substitute these pieces into the main equation.
    2.  Do the algebra to solve for the "new" temperature ($u_i^{t+\Delta t}$).
    3.  The final formula will tell you how to find the temperature at a node using its current value and its neighbors' current values. Just follow the math, don't worry about the physics.
